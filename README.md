### Info

This was a website I made over the weekend for my cousin! My cousin has 2 puppies, Bailey and Toto, and I could never tell them apart. So I got inspired to make this 'Find Toto' game after learning some CSS card tricks online. Please visit her YouTube channel, BaiToto! She makes quality videos, and it's definitely worth subscribing! I also really wanted to practice using Vue with the CLI and Vue Router. Initially, I wanted to do this with React, but after having learnt both, Vue was simply the much more enjoyable choice to code in.
